		<p class="greenText">World War I raged through Europe. With the advent of the machine gun and rapid-fire field artillery gun and the use of tanks, warplanes and chemical weapons, there were massive casualties. Many artists and intellectuals sought refuge in Switzerland, as a neutral country. Hugo Ball was one of these artists. After arriving in Zurich, Ball founded Dada and established the Café Voltaire as a central gathering and performance space for the movement.</p>
